        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
        Hi, I'm Amy Lee. I recently returned home to Nashville after traveling around for a bit. After college graduation, I moved to Boston to work in the tech scene, which is where I developed my passion for technology and its great ability to change global problems. After Boston, I solo traveled around Nepal for several months to gain perspective and experience a new place. While living in Nashville this past year, I decided to make my dreams a reality and enrolled in the Nashville Software School to master the skills I need to use technology to affect positive change in the world.</p>

During my year there, I learned the ins and outs of start-up life and immersed myself in the tech scene, which is where I developed y passion for technology adn its great ability to change the world. After the end of the start-up, I decided I wanted to experience more of the world, and shortly hopped on a plane to solo travel around Nepal for several months. If you're ever curious about Nepali culture, I'd be happy to share my tales over coffee of trekking through the Himilayas, living in an orphanage, losing my passport, and, most of all, the kindess of Nepali people.

        When I returned home, I landed a part-time remote position at Cool People Care Inc. Still bit by the travel bug, I packed my bags and moved to Puerto Rico while working remotely and taking the role as a night manager at a hostel a few nights a week. After three months, I returned to Nashville to accept a job at C615, a company that is developing and fostering innovation in East Nashville. I recently decided -->
